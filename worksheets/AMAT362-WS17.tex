\begin{questions}

\question[1] Suppose a number is generated uniformly at random from the unit interval $(0,1)$, i.e. $X\sim \text{Unif}(0,1)$. What's the probability of $X$ being within 2 decimal places of .35, after rounding? For example, .349 would round up to .35 and .353 would round down.

\vspace{1.2in}

\question[1] Repeat the question above except under the assumption that $X\sim \text{Norm}(0,1)$ distribution, i.e. normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1.

\question[5] Suppose $X$ is a random variable whose density is $f(x)=cx(1-x)$ for $0<x<1$ and $f(x)=0$ otherwise.

\question[4] \emph{We'll do this in class, but please copy down the derivations and understand them!}
Recall that $X$ is exponentially distributed with parameter $\lambda$, written $X\sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$, if its PDF is $f_X(x)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x\geq 0$ and is zero otherwise.

\part[1] Derive a formula for the median of $X$ in terms of $\lambda$. This is also called the \emph{half-life}, which measures the amount of time needed for a sample of radioactive material to degrade by half or for some chemical to degrade or be absorbed by half. Bonus question: what is the half-life of caffeine?
