\question[3]
\emph{Electrical Components:} Suppose there are two electrical components in a device. The chance that the first component fails is 10\%. If the first component fails then the chance that the second component fails is 20\%. If the first component works, the chance the second component fails is only 5\%.

\question[2] A light bulb company has factories in two cities. The factory in city $A$ produces two thirds of the company's light bulbs. The remainder are produced in city $B$, and of these, 1\% are defective. Among all bulbs manufactured by the company, what proportion are not defective and made in city $B$?
