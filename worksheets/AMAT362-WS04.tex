\begin{questions}
\question[4]
An urn contains 15 red balls, 20 green balls and 12 yellow balls. Consider the experiment where we draw two balls without replacement. Consider the event $A$ where exactly one red ball {\em or} one yellow ball is drawn.

\begin{parts}
\part[2] Decompose the event $A$ into three mutually exclusive events and use this decomposition to compute the probability of $A$.

\vspace{1.8in}

\part[2] Notice that $A$ is the union of the events
\[
  R=\{\text{exactly one red ball is drawn}\} \cup Y=\{\text{exactly one yellow ball is drawn}\}
\]
Why are these events not disjoint? Compute $P(A)$ using the formula $$P(A)=P(R)+P(Y)-P(R\cap Y).$$

\part[1]
What's the probability that you draw 2 red, 2 green and 1 yellow?

\part[1]
