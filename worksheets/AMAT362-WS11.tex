\begin{questions}

\question[1] What is the expected number of sixes appear on 3 die rolls? What is the expected number of odd numbers?

\question[1] Let $X$ be the number of spaces in 7 cards dealt from a well shuffled standard 52 card deck. What is $E(X)$?

\vspace{1in}

\question[6] A fair six-sided die is rolled 2 times. Let $L$ denote the number of times a value strictly less than 4 is rolled. Let $M$ denote the number of times a 4 is rolled. Let $H$ denote the number of times a 5 or 6 is rolled.

\question[1] Suppose $E(X^2)=3$, $E(Y^2)=4$, $E(XY)=2$. Find $E((X+Y)^2)$.

\question[2] In a circuit containing $n$ switches, the $i^{th}$ switch is closed with probability $p_i$. Let $X$ denote the total number of switches that are closed. What is $E(X)$?
